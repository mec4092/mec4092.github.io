# The Past Project
> This repository contains an educational project that explores a turning point in Tudor history: the conflict between England and the Spanish Armada. Following a non-linear narrative model, an interactive player interest storyboard game is used to examine the causes and effects of the Spanish Armada’s defeat by England. Players gain an appreciation of radical shift in power that transformed England into a major global leader and altered the course of colonialism around the world for centuries.

## General Information
- The intended audience includes secondary level students and teachers who can use a digital history game as an educational, fun tool. The game immerses players within a multi-leveled historical account about the motives for key decisions made by the major figures in the medieval maritime conflict, including England, Spain, and the Papacy. The purpose of the project is to give students an appreciation of the challenging problems and difficult decisions that shape history. Teachers may find the game to be a useful tool to show that history is more than a set of facts, since the way that the story is told using the facts also matters and can affect how the story is perceived.

## Technologies Used
- Twine - version 2.7.1
- Harlowe - version 3.3.0
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Features
- Embedded historical images with a Creative Commons-license from Wikimedia Commons
- A changing variable value based on the number of coins that are collected or cashed in as the player makes a decision about rewards
- A key to unlock a reward in terms of coins that the player collects as coins while the game is played 
- The use of conditional statements to determine whether or not a player has met the coin amount needed to unlock the reward
- A player name variable that personalizes name messages throughout the passages and a special message that only displays to a player who enters the name Elizabeth in honor of the Tudor queen.
-User input macros where the player must decide what option to follow and deal with the consequences of the choice

## Project Status
This project is considered complete based on the digital project requirements set by my George Mason University history course (HIST 390: Tech & the Tudors).

## Room for Improvement
The storyboard can always be improved upon to create a richer immersive player experience.

Room for improvement:
- One improvement would be to add more images, background color, and font color or style that can make the passages more visually engaging.
- A second improvement would be to add music to complement the content of the passages.
- A third improvement would be to add more passages that provide better context to Spanish Armada battle such as decisions made by the Duke and expand on the consequences faced by the remaining Spanish sailors who returned to Spain.
